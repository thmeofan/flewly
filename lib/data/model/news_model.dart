      text:
          'Microplastics, which are minuscule and practically indestructible fragments originating from plastic products, have become a pervasive issue in our ecosystems, being detected not only in oceans and soil but also in unexpected locations such as our arteries, lungs, and even placentas. The long-lasting nature of microplastics, requiring anywhere from 100 to 1,000 years to degrade, poses a significant threat to our planet and health as their presence continues to escalate.The urgency to find viable alternatives to conventional petroleum-based plastics and microplastics has never been more pressing. Recent findings from a collaborative study between scientists at the University of California San Diego and the materials-science company Algenesis highlight the development of plant-based polymers that biodegrade, even at the microplastic level, in less than seven months. This groundbreaking research, featured in Nature Scientific Reports and authored by UC San Diego professors, alumni, and former research scientists, offers a promising solution to the mounting environmental and health challenges posed by microplastics.Professor Michael Burkart, a co-founder of Algenesis and co-author of the study, emphasizes the critical need to address the implications of microplastics comprehensively, stressing the importance of replacing existing materials with biodegradable alternatives to prevent further accumulation in the environment. Dr. Robert Pomeroy, another co-author and Algenesis co-founder, underscores the initial intent behind the creation of algae-based polymers as being entirely biodegradable, with recent measurements confirming their effective breakdown even at the microparticle level.In rigorous biodegradability assessments, the research team subjected their plant-based polymer to various tests to validate its compostability. Utilizing respirometers, water flotation analyses, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, the researchers confirmed the effective microbial digestion of the material in compost settings, surpassing industry biodegradability standards and showcasing significant degradation compared to petroleum-based microplastics. Scanning-electron microscopy further revealed the colonization of biodegradable microplastics by microorganisms during composting, highlighting the sustainable nature of the novel polymer.',
